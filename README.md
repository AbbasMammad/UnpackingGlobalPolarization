# UnpackingGlobalPolarization
This repository includes two files for the manuscript "Unpacking Global Polarization: Analyzing the Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine on the United Nations." The study examines the effect of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict on global polarization and diplomatic alignments. Using United Nations General Assembly voting data from 1946 to 2022, the research employs various analytical methods, including social network analysis, hierarchical clustering, and k-medoids clustering. By focusing on the cosine similarity of state votes and the frequency of “Yes” votes—indicators of alignment with the international community—the study investigates shifts in global polarization.
